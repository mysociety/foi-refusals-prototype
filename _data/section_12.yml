    <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/36/section/1">Section 1(1) of the FOI Act</a> requires that an authority informs you "whether it holds information of the description specified in the request". If they have not confirmed or denied whether they hold the information, and if they have not cited the cost limit as the reason, reply to the authority, requesting clarification on this point.

    It’s not a requirement, but it is considered good practice by the ICO to provide 'arguments or evidence' for cost calculations. Note that the FOI Act states that it is "the duty of a public authority to provide advice and assistance, so far as it would be reasonable to expect the authority to do so". You could reply to the authority quoting this guidance and asking for more detail.

    If the authority has described how they intend to conduct the search, and you think there is a cheaper way of doing so which they have not considered, you can reply to suggest it (for example, a more refined search term to use across electronic files).

    Section 16 of the FOI Code of Practice advises that bodies should 'provide advice and assistance, so far as it would be reasonable to expect the authority to do so' and the ICO guidance interprets this as providing suggestions of this nature. You could respond to authority asking for such advice.
