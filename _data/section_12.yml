    It’s not a requirement, but it is considered good practice by the ICO to provide 'arguments or evidence' for cost calculations. Note that the FOI Act states that it is "the duty of a public authority to provide advice and assistance, so far as it would be reasonable to expect the authority to do so". You could reply to the authority quoting this guidance and asking for more detail.

    Authorities are advised that requests may only be aggregated if they relate “to any extent” to the same or similar information. This is a wide description which you may be able to argue against.

    You may be able to argue against aggregation on the basis that by law, authorities must respond to requests within 20 working days. The ICO allow "the aggregation period to only run up to 20 days ‘forward’ from the date of any single request under consideration" and "up to 20 days ‘backwards’ from the date of any single request under consideration" and "the total aggregation period (running either forwards or backwards or a combination of both) from the date of any single request must not exceed 60 working days". If the authority has included requests outside these timescales, then you should ask for an internal review, <a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/1199/costs_of_compliance_exceeds_appropriate_limit.pdf">linking to ICO advice (PDF)</a>.
